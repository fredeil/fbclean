# Facebook cleaner

Chrome extension that removes unwanted spam from you Facebook feed (by manipulation the DOM).
I got fed up with nonsense tagging and people going to events and stuff.
Easiest solution would be to delete Facebook, but I did this instead.

## Features

* No tracking
* No bitcoin mining

## Usage

To use this chrome extension you have to activate developer mode on chrome (see [link](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted)).

Then you just download this repo and load the extension into your chrome browser. Easy as that.
